# EmoteScript

To get this script Running, you have to install AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/) in the installer pick the Ansi-32-Bit Version.

The Script opens the Chat with "T" so if you want to use this Script you have to set your chat bind to "T".
And it also switches the current Window with ALT-ESC, so if you deactivated this in your windows settings this script won't work.
